# brandonguo.dev

Welcome to my portfolio site! This was originally cloned off of the [Portfolio Blog Starter](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates) and modified to fit my needs.

The original template includes: 
- MDX and Markdown support
- Optimized for SEO (sitemap, robots, JSON-LD schema)
- RSS Feed
- Dynamic OG images
- Syntax highlighting
- Tailwind v4
- Vercel Speed Insights / Web Analytics
- Geist font

I added in my own support for:
- Shadcn UI
- Aceternity UI
- Framer Motion

### Clone and Deploy

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/BrandonGuocamole/portfolio blog
```

Then, run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying)).
