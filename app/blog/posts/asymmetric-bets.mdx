## Job Risk vs. Career Risk

If you haven't already, check out Erik Torenberg's thoughts on [job risk and career risk](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/take-asymmetric-bets). As a quick summary, job risk is the risk of losing your job, while career risk is the risk of longterm career impact. 

The difference is that job risk is a one-off risk, while career risk is a long-term risk.

## The Zoomer Dilemma
We are in the thick of witnessing and participating in a revolution that's tailor-made for our strengths and the times we've grown up in.
When I look at the opportunities that my generation — the Zoomers — have before us, it's clear that we're uniquely positioned to take what I'd call asymmetric career bets. 


However, at the same time, I am seeing almost all of my peers choose the most risk-averse paths possible.

Our generation has come of age in an era defined by rapid technological advancements and an unparalleled openness to entrepreneurial risks. We've watched startups become empires overnight and seen how technology can disrupt industries that seemed impregnable just a decade ago. We aren't just observing these changes; we're at the heart of them, crafting the tools and platforms that propel these transformations.

The speed of development today is astounding. Open source tools and developer infrastructures, which are more sophisticated and accessible than ever, allow us to turn ideas into prototypes in a matter of hours. Where previous generations had to invest significant capital in basic infrastructure, we can bootstrap with cloud services and a wide array of programming frameworks at minimal cost.

## Funding Ecosystem
The funding ecosystem is another area where Zoomers have an edge. Venture capital used to be the realm of the elite, but now it's becoming democratized, with early-stage investors willing to place bets on young, unproven teams. This shift is partly due to the successes of young founders, which have changed the perception of what inexperienced teams can achieve.

Moreover, the rise of remote work and global collaboration platforms means that we can now tap into the best talent worldwide, irrespective of geographic boundaries. This global network not only enhances our ability to build diverse teams but also allows us to understand and enter international markets more easily than ever before.

So, what does an asymmetric bet look like for a Zoomer? It’s about leveraging our innate comfort with technology and our native understanding of digital-native platforms to create solutions that might seem risky or implausible to older generations. It's about envisioning a future that others can't see and having the audacity to reach for it.
